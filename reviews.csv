its really worth every single penny it works like one ton ac provided that your room has proper ventilation i generally keep cooler near to window so that it can pull fresh air from outside and as a result i get very cool air one more suggestion please dont buy cooler which are equipped with a blower fan always go for the cooler equipped with metal fan like this one in one word this compton cooler is amazing if you find the review helpful please thumps up happy summer,positive

great packaging by seller as this was the most important point while transportation from jaipur to chennai secondly product is quite huge and air throw is very much nearly 13ft at 2 speed and will give good breeze cooling is satisfying due to honeycomb cooling media no need of filling water daily price is high but product is quite satisfactory compared to others only drawback is the motor power is 190 w rather than 220w which should be coorected on specs information on flipkart good j,positive

very good quality product better than my expectations if you provide good ventilation it does nice cooling then i could feel the air 25 feet away couldnt try more than that but i think you could feel it a bit more far away as well water easily lasts for about 89 hours good in this price9200 range after 10 percent discount,positive
delivery was on time flipkart service was awesome on time but the cooler doesnt seem to be so costly as it doesnt cool really well even after filling it up with full water it can be ok during warm nights but it wont make you feel any ease in hot conditions the plastic build also looks very cheap and below standard i am ok with it but not very satisfied,positive

a good cooler by crompton the height of the cooler is about 3ft 10 inch color is nice plastic body is average air blow is good at any stage 12 or 3 air swing is also 3 choice when you switch it on for the first time after filling the water you will feel the nice cold air you will feel cool if you use it according to the weather there is a ice tray on the top overall a good cooler i will give 45 for design 35 for plastic body 45 for fan speed 45 for fan swing,positive
very bad ever packageing by flipkart i have seen when i open its outer layer its been already open looks like used product air throw quality is not good as expected its water meter is very top of its water tank if you want to see its minimum level of water then u have to fill atlest 50 liter of water no any support of up and down its air wing and its not cover very much area overall just ok not very satisfied,negative

crompton offers this range of coolers ozone with multiple capacity of water tank though the fan motor and air flow capacity remains the same which should not have been the case i bought the 88 litre model satisfied with cooling but the castor wheels are not strong enough for the weight of 88 litre filled water tank suggestion is to go for 75 litre instead of 88 litre variant,negative

have been using for almost a month now one thing you definitely need to know is keep the cooler where fresh air ventilation is there otherwise the room will just become humid the cooling for me has not been that great dont know exactly how it provides maximum cooling and not make the room more humid using it in pune climate it partially does the job for me if anyone has had good experience with the product can help me out on how the maximum cooling can be achieved,positive

best in the classextremely light and awesome looks and very easy to maneuver around thanks to the 4 wheels at each corner with wheel locking feature talking about its main function that is cooling so let me tell you it worth every penny and cools the room in around 10 min of medium size it got 5 iron blades which works fine and tank capacity is very large i would recommend go for the lower capacity which would cost 1000 rupees less,positive

writing this review after using this cooler for 4 months in nagpur where temperature goes till 48 degrees and is an extremely hot regionlight weight sturdy stylish does not make a lot of noise either this cooler will work absolutely fine until march but during the months of april and may when summer will be at its peak it will work only as a personal cooler and youll have to keep it hardly 1 meter away from yourself to feel the cool air,positive
this is a cooler so please do not expect ac like cooling this provides good amount of cold air the room may become humid in placesregions with higher humidity so please use cross ventilation this is a value for money product and it is pretty big looks very good in room the air throw is sufficient for rooms with 150250 sqft size the delivery was good and the delivery personnel went out of his way to help get the huge package to 2nd floor thanks a lot,positive
the cooler was home delivered it came in good condition the cooler operation is simple the wheels are sturdy and it is easy to move around the main problem is with the manual the manual does not give details on how to clean the filters and how to drain the water tank the manufacturer could have created a simple youtube video on how to do this and not left it to the amateurs,positive
its excellentwill feel some odour for 1 or 2 days due to honeycomb but then the smell will gopls dont forget to have some space behind cooler otherwise humidity will increase i felt the same but when i changed locationit if giving wonderful resultsrequires ac comforters after 2 hourswater tank capacity is good and it will last for more than whole night in continuous usewater level indicator is very clear wheels are good and locking system is also there overall worthy and good,positive
giving this review after 4 months usage this is really good cooler cooling 1211 bedroom within 2 hours but proper ventilation should be there lit it sound is there i think the sound is common for all coolers this is good recommended to buy,positive
wonderful product as expected reduces the room temperature nice air flow intial use will give a stink smell after first five hours everything seems to be normal ice chamber does its job for best results mix some ice while filling the tank cord length is small but manageable flipkart delivered in a week packing was perfect 5 for now will re review after few weeks,positive
loved it excellent air thruogh i searched almost 15 days for best cooler finally got good one with reasonable price thanks to flipkart and crompton,positive
air throw is very disappointingi thought it was a good cooler but its not they mentioned that it is for 450sq feet but it cant even cool my little 150sq feet room in 40 degree temp also i have tried all the way for ventilation but it always creates humidity and thats the bad part i suggest to dont buy this you can even buy a local brand cooler from the show which far better than this,negative
product is good with good look and compact designairflow is also good while considering for medium hallbut the problem is if you try to adjust ventsblades they will automatically bend downwards due to airforce it would be better if they stand still however we want,positive
i have purchased this cooler from flipkart its an amazing products value for money you have to use blanket if you run this cooler at high speed even in hot hummid summer guys please go ahead and buy it this cooler can chilled a room size 400 to 500 sqft thank you flipkart i love this product,positive
after use of one month very nice product work well less sound better cooling,positive
its excellent product from crompton superb cooling without any sound light weight beautifully designed very good qualitythanks flipkart for amazing producti am satisfied with this purchase thanks a lot to seller and flipkart,positive
it is old model and dont have outlet for draining dirty water we have to clean it manually and do lot of physical work usually the water becomes stinky once in a month we have to remove the screws and use motor to pump out the water the screws are not stainless steel so they get rusted easily and makes it difficult to remove the wheels get stuck within a month theres no manual how to remove and clean honeycomb the only positive point is its air throwing capacity and ability to cool,negative
very good productreliable product from the brand not disappointed this tym after returning usha air king which was a wasteyou can go for this one for sure good air thrownice cooling ice chamber castor wheel evrythng working just great only one thing which i want to highlt is just the front louver the osclitor is good working perfectly but the front oscltor should hve been better overall great buy go for it,positive
value for money but bit noisy good enough for large rooms need good air cross section water capacity is hugegood air throw noisy enough to keep outside cant watch tv while cooler is in room,positive
i baught this cooler looking at the number of reviews and rating as i always do and as expected cooler built quality is good but the main function of cooling has a design defect the water supplied through the channel has some design defect because of which none of the honeycomb panels gets wet completely and hence cooling effect is very less people may not have noticed this if they are from relatively not that hot places like pune mumbai or bangalore etc i would not recommend this product,negative
very good product if you have a cross ventilation in your room so this product is so nice for you very less noise and give a instant cool air a little humidity fan speed is very good appropriate value for money,positive
it is a very good product you must buy it it has three side honeycomb pad and dis cooler gave a very nice air flow its exact height is 10 cm and you dont be hesitate to buy this product it has good swing and nice water tank of capacity 88 litres and i got a good delivery by flipkart and crompton is a good brand,positive
not a great product the finishing of the product is not look like it is branded one just looks like ordinary roadside product not expected this type of product from crompton i have shared my view after 2 days of usage the 3 star is for its price go for symphony this is not trust worthy,negative
good,positive
this product is very nice and good the motor was working good at very speed and very cool,positive
excellent air cooling the water will last you easily for two nights n the cooling gets real effective if u place it near a window n yes just make sure you change ur water every week so to keep it clean n free from any smell its size is similar to ur 16 l fridge but much slimer n yeah thats all for now but will update my review soon after quarter year,positive

if placed in a well ventilated area the cooling of this desert cooler is pretty decent the water tank of 88 liter is enough for a full day continuous use built quality is robust the delivery experience was very good as the product was delivered with proper company packing and was handeled with care,positive
cooler is good but air up done setting is not good but all is ok i am happy you can purchase this cooler very nice product,positive
to be very honest with you i was a bit sceptical before buying this product wheather it will be able to live up to my expectationsbut after using this product for the last 5 months it has removed all the doubts i had yes a small shout to you guys over here its not a ac so dont expect it will cool the entire room within half an hour or it will work like a window ac and alli can share some tips which will definitely help you to get decent cooling experience make sure the water f,positive

satisfied with this product super air flow amazing built quality height is good cooling is also good its not offering many features but i think its main function as a good cooler its work best for me i review this after 1 month of used,positive
cooler is nice but have some drawbacks as well i will focus on only draw backs because whatever feature it claims it has them upto mark 1 it is useful only for one person2 it will work only when proper cross ventilation is available other wise would create unbearable humidity in the atmosphere of your room or house3 front flabs are loos ened after use and they can not guide the air properly so everytime you will have to guide them in your direction it will irritate you especially i,positive
i would certainly recommend symphony cooler in this range because earlier i hav experience with symphony and now i had purchased this 1 month agosymphony is superior to crompton1 less noise2 better air delivery,positive
well i was confused between hindware and crompton but finally i went with this only as motor king is crompton only air flow is awesomelight weightcoolness is fantasticif you trust on brand you can blindly go with thiswin win situation thank you flipkart for awesome delevery experience as usual,positive
crompton 75l desert cooler is the best coolerits cooling effect is very good even in moderate temperaturecooling remains for longer time not only when it is onand it cools large area for effective cooling not like tower or personal coolervery happy with purchase highly recommended for better and effective cooling,positive
excellent cooler work well only when window are open for ventilation provide decent cooling with water when ventilation is provided,positive
air cooler is working well giving heat relief from summer heat provided cross ventilation is good less noise its better to connect water hose to air cooler directly and due to water evaporation the 70ltr water doesnt last for the whole nightit has inbuilt wheels sturdy to move across the room highly recommend this product,positive
excellent air cooler i am very happy and good sellers and good flipkart,positive
good product on fully hot summer if you are living in place like humidity area it not helps to cool you,positive
working well and cooling is also greati liked this product and ill also get a great deal as compared to market price,positive
delievered in just 24 hours after the order which is in good condition as it is well packed cooling was very good when compared to previous coolers worth the money paid for it good service too,positive
fantastic air throw and yet quiet fan great cooling and cool design,positive
i ama truly satisfied with the product it cools the room very well even if the temperature is more than 42 degree celcius i live in a place where the temperature goes more than 40 degree in the mid summer i stay on the top floor but since i am using this cooler i am having no problem due to excessive temperature which i used to face before you just have to place the cooler in the right place with the right and scientific procedure,positive
better plastic quality than symphony better price honey comb panelssleek suggest every symphony fan to give it a try as it is better in terms of product quality symphony quality has decreased a lot in few years,positive
good product given same model which one i choose delivered safely i love flipkart services that i owe till now thanks flipkart team for wonderful job you are doing,positive
in short it is better than snowcrest 85 which is one of the best air coolers out there crompton machines are less noisy and the air throw is wide and thats where snowcrest gets beaten but on the bright side the latter throws higher volumes of air i personally think that crompton is best for rooms whereas snowcrest from hindware is better suited for bigger halls,positive
the best in this price range with excellent air throw sufficient for a hall and adequate cooling adequate ventilation is needed to work properlyworks best when kept near a window and another window should be opened to push humidity outwater lasts for 1 to 2 daysthis cooler can make the difference in hot climate when it brings down the room temperature the new smell goes off in a week a good choice to combat summer heatps thanks flipkart for the brilliant delivery,positive
pros the best cooling out there with 75l liter capacity and plastic used is also really good cons plugg in cable length is not even half meter and huge noise which will not allow you to sleep so what is the point it is like giving you an ak47 without bullet you have a wonderful gun but you cannot use it for the purpose you got it for,positive
cooler recd in good condition from flipkart within delivery timequality of cooler is so wise as per expectationair circulation and flow is too good with honeycomb colling effectthanks to flipkart for providing valuable product,positive
good product works best when kept near a window and when outside temperature is low it cools like a mini ac overall nice product solves the purpose in places where temp raises to 35 to 38 degrees,positive
very nice cool breeze liked it very much,positive
just go for itone of the best model and best cooling efficiency compared to all other companies but place it before the window and enjoy the air conditioning loving iti bought it for 9878 which is an offer priceloved alot enjoying the chilling room,positive

i bought this after comparing over 30 different types of coolers its cooling is good but nothing compared to desert coolers like kenstar cyclone 12 what i observed that the cooling pads at the back are not properly soaked in water compared to side cooling pads this maybe the reason why cooling is lesser still its better than most coolers out there in marketprosit looks classy low noisehuge 70l tankpowerful 180 degree airthrowconsno indicator light no single switch to turn o,positive

it is worth every single penny i bought this cooler for the indoor room where air ventilation is not much but this cooler performs really well for that room the fan motor is very powerful and the water tank is also has a good capacity it cools the room very well where there is no ventilation if it gets the air ventilation it will perform much better please go for it but keep in mind the service for this cooler is very expensive more than acbecause the honey grass are real expensive,positive

am writing this review after using the product for a monththe built quality is good and the cooling efficiency is very nice when it is placed near to the windowthe only concern with it is no water outlet found at the bottom when you want to release the water or clean the cooler,positive
excellent i recommend it but you need fill drinking water 25ltrs for 10 hours approximately and using soft water drinking is best to retain the water pump life little bit noisy in fast mode useful for 20 x 11 sqft area,positive
cooler is great but its tough to serve the water into it is little difficult if the water resources are less with you but in terms of cooler its great enough for big hall 25x30ft,positive

while the fan and motor quality is good the problem with this cooler is its body the plastic is not very strong and the vent in front is problematic as the horizontal plastic pieces do not remain at their place leading to less air flow it is a big let down and request crompton to replace the plastic mesh in future rest of the body is also quite shaky,negative

1 the fan speed was too good 2 cooling is very nice and in summer too it had given immense cooling effect355 litres capacity so half day sufficient for usagein summerin winter more hours it will run with that water4 there is valve at bottom so we can drain out the water and can keep it aside in non usage period like winter5 shape was too good go for it blindly,positive
